# Library support for Safe Coding Practices

The way we structure libraries and APIs affect the idioms that are
available to developers.

If the easiest ways to express ideas are also secure against a
particular class of attack, then developers who have seen ideas
expressed those ways will tend to produce code that is secure
against that class of attack.

Next, we introduce a few such idioms, show how they can be better
addressed via a rarely used but powerful JavaScript
feature, and end with some ideas on how to foster consistent,
powerful, and secure APIs for a class of problems that often have
security consequences: composing structured strings to send to
external agents.
