# Shell Injection during Production

[Shell injection][] occurs when an attacker-controlled string changes
the structure of a command passed to a shell or causes a child process
to execute an unintended command or with unintended arguments.
Typically, this is because code or a dependency invokes
[child\_process][api/child_process] with an argument partially
composed from untrusted inputs.

Shell injection may also occur during development and deployment.  For
example, [npm][npm hooks] and [Bower][bower hooks]
`{pre-,,post-}install` hooks may be subject to shell injection via
filenames that contain shell meta-characters in malicious transitive
dependencies but we classify this as an [MTP][] vulnerability.
